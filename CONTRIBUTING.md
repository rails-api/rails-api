Contributing to rails-api
=========================

Please file issues on the [GitHub Issues list](https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api/issues).

Please discuss new features or ask for feedback about a new feature [on
rails-api-core](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rails-api-core).

If you want a feature implemented, the best way to get it done is to submit a
pull request that implements it. Tests and docs would be nice.
